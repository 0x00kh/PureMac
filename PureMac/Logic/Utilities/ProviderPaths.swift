/// keeps a database of what it believes is on disk. Removing a file underneath it
/// with `unlink` does not tell the provider anything, so its snapshot and the
/// filesystem drift apart. `fileproviderctl check` then reports invariants like
/// `is_on_disk_but_not_in_FS_Snapshot`, and Finder copies out of iCloud Drive slow
/// from instant to tens of seconds because every read goes through reconciliation.
/// A user reported exactly this after one cleanup: 513 of 19693 files broken, and
/// the live service rebuilt the inconsistent state ~10s after each repair.
///
/// These directories are implementation detail owned by `bird`, `cloudd`, and
/// `fileproviderd`. They are never junk, they are never safe to reclaim, and no
/// amount of space saved justifies corrupting a user's cloud sync state.
